A full-system filebrowser for the Nintendo Switch, written in C++.

# Usage
Copy the .nro to your Switch folder and load through the homebrew menu. 

Use the A button to enter a partition/directory, B button to go back, and + to exit.

Press X to copy a file, and Y to paste the file either to the SD card, or the same partition (does not currently work across system partitions). There is currently no indicator during a copy, only after, so give large files some time to copy.


# TODO
    *Text wrapping for directories with a lot of entries (does not work well right now)
    *Add the ability to copy files to/from the SD card
    *Add the ability to view files
    *Add other major filebrowser utilities
    *Add support for more partition types
    *Majorly refactor codebase
    *Prettify!
